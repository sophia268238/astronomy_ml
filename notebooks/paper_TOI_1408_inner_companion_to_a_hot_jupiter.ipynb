    "## Terms\n",
    "- TTV: transit timing variation\n",
    "- TDV: transit duration variation\n",
    "- RV: radial velocity\n",
    "- Eccentricity:  $ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{b^2}{a^2}} $ where a, b are the semi-major/minor axis\n",
    "- Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Filters(ugriz):\n",
    "    - u: ultraviolate ~300-400nm\n",
    "    - g: green ~400-550nm\n",
    "    - r: red ~550-700nm\n",
    "    - i: infrared ~700-850\n",
    "    - z: infrared ~850-950\n",
    "- Photodynamic Model: a comprehensive approach that cobines phothmetric data (light curves) and dynamical information (orbital mechanics) to study and characterize exoplanets.\n",
    "- RV Semi-amplitude: The half of the total range of the radial velocity variation. For instance, if the RV of a star values from -10 km/s to +10 km/s, the semi-amplitude would be 10 km/s.\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ and R in RV analysis:\n",
    "    - $\\lambda$: the wavelength of light being observed. In the context of radial velocity studies, it typically refers to the specific wavelengths at which spectral lines are observed.\n",
    "    - R: The spectral resolution (R) is a dimensionless number that describes the resolving power of a spectrograph. $$R = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\Delta \\lambda}$$\n",
    "- Proper motion ($\\mu$)\n",
    "    - The proper motions in Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) represent the star's motion across the sky, projected onto these two celestial coordinate axes.\n",
    "    - It gives insight into a star's velocity relative to the Sun and can help in understanding the star's orbit within the galaxy.\n",
    "    - High proper motion stars are generally closer to us, as distant stars move very slowly across the sky due to their great distance.\n",
    "    - Unit: milliarcseconds per year (mas/yr)\n",
    "- Grazing Planet\n",
    "  - A grazing planet refers to a planet that passes very close to its host star during a transit, but does not completely cover it.\n",
    "- V mag: visual magnitude ~550nm (green)\n",
    "- J mag: near infra-red manitude ~1250nm"

    "- In section 2.1.2. ground-based photometry, all the ground based observations were based on the `i` band. Why using the `i` band?\n",
    "- Didn't find PyTTV (Korth et al. 2023) the python tool used in TTV analysis."
